        I chose to pursue an MSc degree in order to improve my research, critical thinking and 
        analysis skills. Furthermore, this has given me the opportunity to hone other 
        skills such as technical writing, project management, and 
        effective communication.

        I want to be a developer at SovTech because I want to be one of the best developers
        in the industry. SovTech is the perfect place to start a development career given that the company
        is very dynamic and focuses solely end-to-end custom software development. Consequently, I believe
        that if I Sovtech I will consistently get pushed to become the best version of myself.
