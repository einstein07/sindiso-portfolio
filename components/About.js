      <p>
        Hello! I'm Sindiso Mkhatshwa, a 3rd year Master of Science (MSc) candidate at the University 
        of Cape Town. My MSc is by dirssetation, specializing in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to pursue an MSc degree in order to improve my research, critical thinking and 
        analysis skills. Furthermore, this has given me the opportunity to hone other 
        skills such as technical writing, project management, and 
        effective communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always open to grab a beer while chatting about tech, sports and everything else inbetween!   
      </p>
